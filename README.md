# Visual-Sorting-Algorithms
This is a visualization of sorting algorithms. It's a program that can visualize every sorting alorithm.
------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to try visualize a sorting algorithm that's not in the algorithms folder, you just need to use the ``ColumnHolder.update(window, index, new_column)`` or ``ColumnHolder.swap(window, low, high)`` method whereever you update/swap your values.
In the ``algorithms folder`` you can see some examples for both cases.
